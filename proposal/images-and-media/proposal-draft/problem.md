### üß® Problem: No usable DAO voting tools exist for Midnight, despite rising demand for anonymous governance

Midnight is designed to support confidential smart contracts and privacy-preserving use cases. However, **there is currently no DAO voting tool, prototype, or frontend dApp that demonstrates how anonymous governance can be implemented on Midnight.**

As DAO adoption grows across ecosystems, the **need for anonymous voting becomes increasingly important** ‚Äî especially for sensitive governance topics, conflict-prone communities, or regulatory risk mitigation.

Yet:

* üõë **No DAO frameworks exist on Midnight**
* ‚ùå **No commit‚Äìreveal frontend templates are available**
* üîí **No UI/UX examples for anonymous voting flows**
* üß± **No open source SDKs or workflows for integrating privacy into governance UIs**

This creates a critical blocker for both Midnight-based builders and external DAO projects looking to adopt privacy-first governance tools.

Even mature DAO ecosystems like **Catalyst (Cardano)**, **Nouns DAO (Ethereum)**, or **Aragon** face significant friction in experimenting with private voting unless a usable front-end reference implementation is available.

As a result:

* Projects either **avoid sensitive topics** or vote off-chain through centralized/private coordination.
* Developers **reinvent privacy flows from scratch**, wasting resources and introducing risk.
* Midnight‚Äôs unique privacy layer remains **underutilized in one of the most relevant real-world use cases: DAO governance.**

A foundational prototype is needed to unlock this capability for all builders in the Cardano and ZK community.
