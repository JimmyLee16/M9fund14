# Solution

### Solution: A standalone dApp for anonymous DAO voting on Midnight

We propose to build a **standalone frontend dApp** that implements a fully anonymous voting flow for DAOs, using Midnight’s native zero-knowledge capabilities.

This dApp will not rely on any external SDKs. Instead, it will directly interact with Midnight smart contracts, following the privacy-first design principles.

#### Key Features:

* 🔐 **Anonymous voting via commit–reveal**: Fully on-chain commit, reveal, and tally stages, using zero-knowledge proofs to protect voter privacy
* 🧑‍⚖️ **DAO-native roles**: Designed around governance-specific actors — _Projects_, _Proposals_, and _Voters_ — instead of generic user models
* 🖥️ **User-friendly interface**: Focus on intuitive UX/UI that demonstrates how anonymous voting can be seamlessly integrated into DAO workflows
* ⚙️ **No middleware or SDK required**: All logic and contract calls are implemented directly in the dApp, with minimal abstraction
* 🔬 **Testnet-compatible**: Runs entirely on the Midnight testnet, using test credentials and wallet stubs where necessary

This project aims to deliver:

* A complete **reference implementation** of anonymous governance on Midnight
* A valuable asset for DAO creators and developers exploring confidential on-chain voting
* A tool for **testing and iterating on privacy-enhanced DAO workflows** without needing third-party infrastructure

By building this application from scratch, we will demonstrate the feasibility and value of **native ZK voting** for DAOs — making confidential governance more accessible to the broader Cardano ecosystem.
